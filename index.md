# About

We are a research group with members based primarily at the
[Observat√≥rio Nacional](http://www.on.br/) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Our interests range from
[3D gravity and magnetic inversion][/papers/paper-magnetization-rock-sample-2016],
[forward modeling][/papers/tesseroid-variable-density],
and
[open-source software development][/papers/verde].
Read more about [our members](/people) and
the [research we do](/papers).

As a group, we strive to set the standard for **open-science** and **reproducibility**.
We publish the source code and data used in our research.
Most new papers will have links to a
[GitHub repository](http://github.com/pinga-lab)
for code and a [DOI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)
(from [figshare](http://figshare.com/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/))
for data and other supplementary material.
