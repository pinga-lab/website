# About

We are a research group with members based primarily at the
[Observat√≥rio Nacional](http://www.on.br/) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Our interests range from
[3D gravity and magnetic inversion][/papers/paper-magnetization-rock-sample-2016],
[forward modeling][/papers/tesseroid-variable-density],
and
[open-source software development][/papers/verde].
Read more about [our members](/people) and the [research we do](/papers).

As a group, we strive to practice **open-science** and make our research freely
available in order to allow **reproducibility**.
We make efforts to publish our papers, codes, supplementary materials and data
at online repositories such as [GitHub](http://github.com/pinga-lab),
[figshare](http://figshare.com/) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
