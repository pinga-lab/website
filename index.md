# About

Our interests range from 3D gravity and magnetic inversion, forward modeling,
and open-source software development.
Read more about [our members](/people),
the [research we do](/research),
and some of our [published papers](/papers).

In the spirit of **open-science** and **reproducibility**,
we try to provide the source code and data used for our papers.
Most new papers will have links to a
[GitHub repository](http://github.com/pinga-lab)
for code and a [DOI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)
(from [figshare](http://figshare.com/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/))
for data and other supplementary material.

We are based at the
[Observat√≥rio Nacional](http://www.on.br/) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
and the
[University of Hawaii at Manoa](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/) in Honolulu,
USA.
