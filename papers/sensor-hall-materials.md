# Abstract

Scanning magnetic microscopy is a tool that has been used to map magnetic fields with good
spatial resolution and field sensitivity. This technology has great advantages over other instruments;
for example, its operation does not require cryogenic technology, which reduces its operational cost
and complexity. Here, we presented a spatial domain technique based on an equivalent layer approach
for processing the data set produced by magnetic microscopy. This approach estimated a magnetic moment
distribution over a fictitious layer composed by a set of dipoles located below the observation plane.
For this purpose, we formulated a linear inverse problem for calculating the magnetic vector and its
amplitude. Vector field maps are valuable tools for the magnetic interpretation of samples with a high
spatial variability of magnetization. These maps could provide comprehensive information regarding the
spatial distribution of magnetic carriers. In addition, this approach might be useful for characterizing
isolated areas over samples or investigating the spatial magnetization distribution of bulk samples at
the micro and millimeter scales. This technique could be useful for many applications that require
samples that need to be mapped without a magnetic field at room temperature, including rock magnetism.
