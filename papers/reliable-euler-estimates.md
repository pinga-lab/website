# Abstract

We propose a novel methodology to select reliable Euler deconvolution estimates
throughout the vertical derivatives of the total-field anomaly, grounded on the
capability of this quantity to locate anomalies due to its higher signal decay
with distance. In applying Euler deconvolution to a small moving-data window, we
compute the standard deviation of the vertical derivatives of the total-field
anomaly for each data window. Then, we define the reliable source-location
estimates as those estimates that are obtained by using the data windows with
the largest standard deviations of the vertical derivatives of the total-field
anomaly. For all tentative values of the structural index (SI), the reliable
estimates with tight clustering define the correct SI and the mean of these
estimates define the source position. We compared our methodology to select
reliable Euler source-position estimates with two available methodologies in
the literature based on the rejection criteria of data amplitude and of depth
uncertainty. We conducted tests on synthetic noise-corrupted data to
investigate the sensitivity of our method to deal with the presence of: i) an
additive nonlinear background that simulates a regional field; ii) interfering
anomalies with distinct amplitudes; iii) weak-, mid-, and strong-interfering
anomalies; and iv) distinct noise levels. Most of tests in the sensitivity
analysis shows that our methodology to select reliable Euler source-position
estimates yielded better interpretation of the simulated magnetic sources than
the methodology based on the rejection criteria of data amplitude and of depth
uncertainty. The only exception was the tests with high noise levels in which
the reliable Euler estimates selected either by our method or by the rejection
criteria yielded poor interpretations. Applications to a real aeromagnetic
survey from southern Brazil interpreted an isolated plug intrusion over the
Anitápolis anomaly and a swarm of shallow-seated dikes with
northwest-southeast trend over the Paranaguá Terrane.
