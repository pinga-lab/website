# About

This paper proposes a new criterion for determining the nature of geological
sources by estimating the correct SI in Euler deconvolution. Due to the high
quality of this work, it has been selected for [Geophysics Bright Spots 2018](https://library.seg.org/doi/10.1190/tle37120934.1).

# Abstract

In most applications, the Euler deconvolution aims to define the nature (type)
of the geologic source (i.e., the structural index \[SI\]) and its depth position.
However, Euler deconvolution also estimates the horizontal positions of the
sources and the base level of the magnetic anomaly. To determine the correct SI,
most authors take advantage of the clustering of depth estimates. We have
analyzed Euler's equation to indicate that random variables contaminating the
magnetic observations and its gradients affect the base-level estimates if, and
only if, the SI is not assumed correctly. Grounded on this theoretical analysis
and assuming a set of tentative SIs, we have developed a new criterion for
determining the correct SI by means of the minimum standard deviation of
base-level estimates. We performed synthetic tests simulating multiple magnetic
sources with different SIs. To produce mid and strongly interfering synthetic
magnetic anomalies, we added constant and nonlinear backgrounds to the anomalies
and approximated the simulated sources laterally. If the magnetic anomalies are
weakly interfering, the minima standard deviations either of the depth or
base-level estimates can be used to determine the correct SI. However, if the
magnetic anomalies are strongly interfering, only the minimum standard deviation
of the base-level estimates can determine the SI correctly. These tests also
show that Euler deconvolution does not require that the magnetic data be
corrected for the regional fields (e.g., International Geomagnetic Reference
Field \[IGRF\]). Tests on real data from part of the Goiás Alkaline Province,
Brazil, confirm the potential of the minimum standard deviation of base-level
estimates in determining the SIs of the sources by applying Euler
deconvolution either to total-field measurements or to total-field anomaly
(corrected for IGRF). Our result suggests three plug intrusions giving rise to
the Diorama anomaly and dipole-like sources yielding Arenópolis and Montes
Claros de Goiás anomalies.
