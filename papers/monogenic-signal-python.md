# Abstract

We have developed codes to calculate the local amplitude, the local phase, and
the local orientation of the nonscale and the Poisson's scale-space monogenic
signals of potential-field data in version 1.0 of the open-source program
Monogenic. The monogenic vector of a generic function is calculated in the
wavenumber domain and then transformed back into the space domain to find the
monogenic signal attributes. We compare the use of the nonscale monogenic
signal with the Poisson’s scale-space monogenic signal in magnetic data. This
comparison shows that the latter can produce better results as an edge
detection filter. The implementation of the monogenic signal can be used to
enhance other geophysical data, such as seismic, ground-penetrating radar,
gravity, multiple-component gravity gradiometry, and magnetic gradient data.
