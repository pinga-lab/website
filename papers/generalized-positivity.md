# Abstract

It is known from potential theory that a continuous and planar layer of dipoles can exactly
reproduce the total-field anomaly produced by arbitrary 3D sources. We prove the existence
of an equivalent layer having an all-positive magnetic-moment distribution for the case in
which the magnetization direction of this layer is the same as that of the true sources,
regardless of whether the magnetization of the true sources is purely induced or not. By
using this generalized positivity constraint, we present a new iterative method for estimating
the total magnetization direction of 3D magnetic sources based on the equivalent-layer
technique. Our method does not impose a priori information either about the shape or depth
of the sources, does not require regularly spaced data, and presumes that the sources have
a uniform magnetization direction. At each iteration, our method performs two steps. The
first one solves a constrained linear inverse problem to estimate a positive magnetic-moment
distribution over a discrete equivalent layer of dipoles. We consider that the equivalent
sources are located on a plane and have an uniform and fixed magnetization direction. In
the second step we use the estimated magnetic-moment distribution and solve a nonlinear
inverse problem for estimating a new magnetization direction for the dipoles. The algorithm
stops when the equivalent layer yields a total-field anomaly that fits the observed data. Tests
with synthetic data simulating different geological scenarios show that the final estimated
magnetization direction is close to the true one. We apply our method to a field data
from the Goiás Alkaline Province (GAP), over the Montes Claros complex, center of Brazil.
The results suggest the presence of intrusions with remarkable remanent magnetization, in
agreement with the current literature for this region.
