# Abstract

We propose a nonlinear gravity inversion for simultaneously estimating the
basement and Moho geometries, as well as the depth of the reference Moho
along a profile crossing a passive rifted margin. We approximate the subsurface
by an interpretation model composed of four layers. The shallowest represents
water and has constant density contrast. The second has a number of sub-layers
with constant density contrasts. The complexity of this layer depends on the
available a priori information at the study area. The third layer represents
the crust and has a predefined horizontal density variation along the profile.
Finally, the deepest layer represents the mantle, with constant density contrast.
Top and base of third layer represent the basement and Moho, respectively.
The constant depth defining the base of the interpretation model defines the
reference Moho. To obtain stable solutions, we impose smoothness on basement
and Moho, force them to be close to previously estimated depths along the
profile and also impose local isostatic equilibrium. Differently from previous
methods, we introduce the information of local isostatic equilibrium by imposing
smoothness on the lithostatic stress exerted at depth. Our method allows deviations
from isostatic equilibrium along the profile, so that the interpreter can obtain a
set of candidate models that fit the observed data and exhibit different degrees
of isostatic equilibrium. Tests with synthetic data show the good performance of
our method at regions with pronounced crustal thinning, which is typical of
passive volcanic margins. Results obtained at the Pelotas basin, an example of
passive volcanic margin at the southern of Brazil, agree with a previous
interpretation obtained independently by using seismic data. These results
show that, combined with a priori information, our method is a promising tool
for interpreting gravity data on passive rifted margins.
