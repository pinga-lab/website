# Abstract

We propose a non-linear gravity inversion for simultaneously estimating the
basement and Moho geometries, as well as the depth of the reference Moho
along a profile crossing a passive rifted margin. To obtain stable solutions,
we impose smoothness on basement and Moho, force them to be close to previously
estimated depths along the profile and also impose local isostatic equilibrium.
Differently from previous methods, we introduce the information of local isostatic
equilibrium by imposing smoothness on the lithostatic stress exerted at depth.
Our method delimits regions that deviates and those that can be considered in local
isostatic equilibrium by varying the weight of the isostatic constraint along the profile.
Besides, it allows controlling the
degree of equilibrium along the profile, so that the interpreter can obtain a set of
candidate models that fit the observed data and exhibit different degrees of
isostatic equilibrium. Our method also differs from earlier studies because it
attempts to use isostasy for exploring (and not necessarily reducing) the inherent
ambiguity of gravity methods.
Tests with synthetic data illustrate the effect of our isostatic constraint on the
estimated basement and Moho reliefs, specially at regions with pronounced crustal
thinning, which are typical of passive volcanic margins. Results obtained by
inverting satellite data over the
Pelotas basin, an example of passive volcanic margin at the southern of Brazil,
agree with previous interpretations obtained independently by combining gravity,
magnetic and seismic data available to the petroleum industry. These results
show that, combined with a priori information, simple isostatic assumptions can be
very useful for interpreting gravity data on passive rifted margins.
