# Abstract

We present a method for inverting total-field anomaly data to estimate the
geometry of a uniformly magnetized 3-D geological source in the subsurface.
The method assumes the total-magnetization direction is known. We approximate
the source by an ensemble of vertically juxtaposed right prisms, all of them
with the same total-magnetization vector and depth extent. The horizontal
cross-section of each prism is a polygon defined by a given number of
equi-angularly spaced vertices from 0○ to 360○, whose polygon vertices are
described by polar coordinates with an origin defined by a horizontal location
over the top of each prism. Because our method estimates the radii of each
polygon vertex we refer to it as radial inversion. The position of these
vertices, the horizontal location of each prism, and the depth extent of all
prisms are the parameters to be estimated by solving a constrained nonlinear
inverse problem of minimizing a goal function. We run successive inversions for
a range of tentative total-magnetization intensities and depths to the top of
the shallowest prism. The estimated models producing the lowest values of the
goal function form the set of candidate solutions. To obtain stabilized
solutions, we impose the zeroth- and first-order Tikhonov regularizations on
the shape of the prisms. The method allows estimating the geometry of both
vertical and inclined sources, with a constant direction of magnetization, by
using the Tikhonov regularization. Tests with synthetic data show that the
method can be of utility in estimating the shape of the magnetic source even in
the presence of a strong regional field. Results obtained by inverting airborne
total-field anomaly data over the Anitápolis alkaline-carbonatitic complex, in
southern Brazil, suggest that the emplacement of the magnetic sources was
controlled by NW-SE-trending faults at depth, in accordance with known
structural features at the study area.
