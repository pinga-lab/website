# Abstract

We improved a magnetic scanning microscope for measuring the magnetic properties of
minerals in thin sections of geological samples at submillimeter scales. The microscope
is comprised of a 200 µm diameter Hall sensor that is located at a distance of 142 µm
from the sample; an electromagnet capable of applying up to 500 mT DC magnetic fields
to the sample over a 40 mm diameter region; a second Hall sensor arranged in a
gradiometric configuration to cancel the background signal applied by the electromagnet
and reduce the overall noise in the system; a custom-designed electronics system to bias
the sensors and allow adjustments to the background signal cancelation; and a scanning XY
stage with micrometer resolution. Our system achieves a spatial resolution of 200 µm with
a noise at 6.0 Hz of 300 nT<sub>rms</sub>/(Hz)<sup>1/2</sup> in an unshielded environment.
The magnetic moment sensitivity is 1.3 × 10<sup>−11</sup> Am<sup>2</sup>. We successfully
measured the representative magnetization of a geological sample using an alternative
model that takes the sample geometry into account and identified different micrometric
characteristics in the sample slice.
