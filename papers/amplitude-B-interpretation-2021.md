# Abstract

We propose the use of the amplitude of the magnetic anomaly vector (amplitude
  data) for qualitative interpretation of large areas at low magnetic
  latitudes. The amplitude data are weakly dependent on the magnetization
  direction. Hence, the amplitude data require no prior knowledge of the source
  magnetization direction. The amplitude data produce maxima over the causative
  sources, allowing the definition of the horizontal projections of the
  sources. This characteristic is attractive for interpretation at low magnetic
  latitudes because at these regions the interpretation of the total-field
  anomaly is not straightforward. We compute the amplitude data using the
  equivalent-layer technique to transform the total-field anomaly into the
  three orthogonal components of the magnetic anomaly vector. We analyze the
  results of tests in synthetic data simulating a main geomagnetic field at
  high, mid and low latitudes, with sources ranging from symmetric to elongated
  forms, including a dipping source. These sources, that give rise to the
  simulated anomalies, have both induced and strong remanent magnetizations.
  By comparing the amplitude data with the total gradient, we show that the
  amplitude data locate the horizontal projections of the sources. Thus, the
  amplitude data can be used to delineate the boundaries of the sources. We
  apply both the amplitude data and the total gradient to a real total-field
  anomaly over a large area of the Amazonian Craton, northern Brazil, located
  at low magnetic latitudes. The amplitude data show a better performance in
  delineating geologic bodies that are in agreement with the outcropping
  intrusions in the geologic map. Moreover, the amplitude data revealed new
  geologic bodies that were not present in the geologic map. The clear
  alignment of these new bodies with the outcropping intrusions suggested the
  continuity of these intrusions in depth. This result is a step forward in
  understanding this area for which the geology is poorly known. Hence, the
  amplitude data can provide an apparent-geologic map especially in areas at
  low latitudes with remanently magnetized bodies.
