# Abstract

Demarcating the continental–oceanic boundary (COB) is extremely important as it
contributes to an understanding of the tectonic environments of marginal basins
through plate reconstructions. In general, the COB is estimated by jointly
interpreting the features of the basement geomorphology, bathymetry and
geophysical datasets, including gravity, magnetic, seismic and geochemical
data. We propose a novel methodology named the tilt-theta angles correlation
(TTAC), a second-order filtering approach to estimate the COB using
high-resolution satellite gravity data. This method computes the angular
difference or correlation angle between the vectors computed from the gradients
of the tilt and theta derivative-based first-order filters. Oceanic regions
generally exhibit small correlation angles (∼0°), thereby indicating a direct
correlation; in contrast, continental regions depict large correlation angles
(∼180°) and thus display an inverse correlation. The TTAC method marks the COB
at the spatial position where the correlation angles abruptly shift from
inverse to direct. Tests using synthetic data and the larger spectral energy
content of TTAC for long wavelengths over tilt, theta and minus of the sign of
vertical derivative (-SiVD) filters attest the effectiveness of the new
methodology over first-order derivative based filters. Additionally, tests
utilizing real data over both the West African Transform Margin (WATM) and
across the South Atlantic Conjugate Margin (SACM) provide favourable results
compared with the previous methodologies used to demarcate the COB. The COB
estimates derived using the new methodology are consistent with the COB
estimates obtained during recent plate-reconstruction studies. We also compare
our results with an earlier interpretation along a conjugate margin
encompassing magma-poor and magma-rich regions. In the complex rifted
environments of the SACM, in which volcanic rocks are dominant, the TTAC
methodology substantially improves the previous COB estimates, thereby
establishing it as an efficient edge marker by simultaneously reducing
small-scale geological noise and enhancing regional-scale geological
contributions.
