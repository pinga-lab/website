# Abstract

We present a gravity-inversion method for estimating the geometry of an
isolated 3-D source, assuming prior knowledge about its top and density
contrast. The subsurface region containing the geological sources is
discretized into an ensemble of 3-D vertical prisms juxtaposed in the vertical
direction of a right-handed coordinate system. The prisms’ thicknesses and
density contrasts are known, but their horizontal cross-sections are described
by unknown polygons. The horizontal coordinates of the polygon vertices
approximately represent the edges of horizontal depth slices of the 3-D
geological source. The polygon vertices of each prism are described by polar
coordinates with an unknown origin within the prism. Our method estimates the
horizontal Cartesian coordinates of the unknown origin and the radii associated
with the vertices of each polygon for a fixed number of equally spaced central
angles from 0o to 360o. By estimating these parameters from gravity data, we
retrieve a set of vertically stacked prisms with polygonal horizontal sections
that represents a set of juxtaposed horizontal depth slices of the estimated
source. This set, therefore, approximates the 3-D source's geometry. To obtain
stable estimates we impose constraints on the source shape. The judicious use
of first-order Tikhonov regularization on either all or a few parameters allows
estimating both vertical and inclined sources whose shapes can be isometric or
anisometric. The estimated solution, despite being stable and fitting the data,
will depend on the maximum depth assumed for the set of juxtaposed 3-D prisms.
To reduce the class of possible solutions compatible with the gravity anomaly
and the constraints, we use a criterion based on the relationship between the
data-misfit measure and the estimated total-anomalous mass computed along
successive inversions, using different tentative maximum depths for the set of
assumed juxtaposed 3-D prisms. In applying this criterion, we plotted the curve
of the estimated total-anomalous mass mt versus data-misfit measure s for the
range of different tentative maximum depths. The tentative value for the
maximum depth producing the smallest value of data-misfit measure in the mt×s
curve is the best estimate of the true (or minimum) depth to the bottom of the
source, depending on whether the true source produces a gravity anomaly that is
able (or not) to resolve the depth to the source bottom. This criterion was
theoretically deduced from Gauss’ theorem. Tests with synthetic data shows that
the correct depth-to-bottom estimate of the source is obtained if the minimum
of s on the mt×s curve is well defined; otherwise this criterion provides just
a lower bound estimate of the source's depth to the bottom. These synthetic
results show that the method efficiently recovers source geometries dipping at
different angles. Test on real data from the Matsitama intrusive complex
(Botswana) retrieved a dipping intrusion with variable dips and strikes and
with bottom depth of 8.0 ± 0.5 km.
