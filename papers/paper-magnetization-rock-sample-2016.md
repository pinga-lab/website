# Abstract

Over the last decades, scanning magnetic microscopy techniques have been
increasingly used in paleomagnetism and rock magnetism. Different from standard
paleomagnetic magnetometers, scanning magnetic microscopes produce
high-resolution maps of the vertical component of the magnetic induction field
(flux density) on a plane located over the sample. These high-resolution
magnetic maps can be used for estimating the magnetization distribution within
a rock sample by inversion. Previous studies have estimated the magnetization
distribution within rock samples by inverting the magnetic data measured on a
single plane above the sample. Here we present a new spatial domain method for
inverting the magnetic induction measured on four planes around the sample in
order to retrieve its internal magnetization distribution. We have presumed
that the internal magnetization distribution of the sample varies along one of
its axes. Our method approximates the sample geometry by an interpretation
model composed of a one-dimensional array of juxtaposed rectangular prisms with
uniform magnetization. The Cartesian components of the magnetization vector
within each rectangular prism are the parameters to be estimated by solving a
linear inverse problem. Our method automatically deals with the averaging of
the measured magnetic data due to the finite size of the magnetic sensor,
preventing the application of a deconvolution before the inversion. Tests with
synthetic data show the performance of our method in retrieving complex
magnetization distributions even in the presence of magnetization
heterogeneities. Moreover, they show the advantage of inverting the magnetic
data on four planes around the sample adn how this new acquisition scheme
improves the estimated magnetization distribution within the rock sample. We
have also applied our method to invert experimentally measured magnetic data
produced by a highly-magnetized synthetic sample that was manufactured in the
laboratory. The results show that, even in the presence of apparent position
noise, our method was able to retrieve the magnetization distribution
consistent with the isothermal remanent magnetization induced in the sample.
