# Abstract

Since the second half of the nineteenth century, a vast literature has been
published on the magnetic modeling of uniformly magnetized ellipsoids.  In this
work, we present a integrated review about magnetic modeling of triaxial,
prolate and oblate ellipsoids, with arbitrary orientation, with or without
remanent magnetization and with both isotropic and anisotropic
susceptibilities. We also bring a theoretical discussion regarding the commom
value of isotropic susceptibility (0.1 SI), widely used by geoscientific
community, and not often discussed, as the limit of which the
self-demagnetization can be overlooked in magnetic modeling. Apparently, this
value was obtained empirically and we propose an alternative way of determining
its limit, based on previous knowledge of the shape and the maximum relative
error allowed in the resultant magnetization. Jointly, we provide a set of
routines capable of modeling the magnetic field produce by triaxial, prolate
and oblate ellipsoidal bodies. These routines are written in Python language as
part of the Fatiando a Terra package.  Examples in this work show the friendly
and easy usage of the program.  Hence, we hope that this work can be useful
both as educational tool (e.g.  Potential Methods and rock magnetism) as to
applied geophysics (e.g.  high susceptibility bodies characterization) and are
