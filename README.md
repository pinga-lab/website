## Contributing to this site

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pinga-lab/website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Dependencies

You'll need to install Urubu and all it's dependencies to build the site. See
file `requirements.txt` for the complete dependency list. The build works on
Python 2.7 or Python 3.5.

You can create a conda environment with all required dependencies by running
`conda env create` in the root of the repository. To activate the environment
and run the build use `source activate pinga-site`.

## Compiling the site

1. Open a terminal (`cmd.exe` on Windows) and go to the root of your clone of this
repository.
2. Run `urubu build` to generate the HTML of the website.
3. Run `urubu serve` to start a simple server at the `_build` folder where the
   built HTML files are.  Point your browser to
   [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to view the site.
   Use `Ctrl+C` to kill the server.

## Adding a publication

The paper entries are `.md` files in the `papers` folder.
The site theme takes a lot of extra metadata in the post to make the "Info"
section of each entry.

To add a new entry, create the `.md` file in the corresponding folder.
Please, follow the naming conventions used for the other files.
