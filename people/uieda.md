# About

My research focuses on inverse problems in potential field
geophysics with a heavy dose of open-source software development.
I do my best to bring more openness to the scientific process
and to train the next generation of scientists in the best practices of
reproducible computational experiments.
I'm leading the [Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab](https://www.compgeolab.org),
PINGA's sister lab and a virtual research group where we design computational
methods for geophysical data processing, forward modeling, and inversion.
