# About

I am currently working at the
[University of Hawaii at Manoa](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/index.html)
where I'm developing the
[Python bindings for the Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.gmtpython.xyz/)
and doing research in inverse problems and interpolation of geodetic data.
Prior to coming here, I worked for 4 years as Assistant Professor of Geophysics
at the [Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ)](http://www.uerj.br),
Brazil.
There, I developed and taught courses in geophysics and
programming and numerical methods.
I received my PhD from the Observat√≥rio Nacional, Brazil, for the
creation of the open-source software [Tesseroid](http://www.tesseroids.org) and
[Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org/) and for my
[work on large-scale gravity inversion][/papers/paper-moho-inversion-tesseroids-2016].

My research focuses on inverse problems in potential field
geophysics with a heavy dose of open-source software development.
I do my best to bring more openness to the scientific process
and to train the next generation of scientists in the best practices of
reproducible computational experiments.

In the spirit of open-science,
I share all of the research and
teaching material online under permissive licenses.
You'll find links to source code, images, lessons, etc,
throughout my [personal website](http://www.leouieda.com).

Follow me on [Twitter (@leouieda)](https://twitter.com/leouieda)
and [Github (@leouieda)](https://github.com/leouieda)
for updates on teaching and research, random things from the world of academia,
etc.
