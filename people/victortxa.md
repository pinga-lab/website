# About

I work at LAGEX/UERJ since December 2014. I did a MSc in Geophysics at UFF,
where I worked with seismic refraction tomography, implementing an algorithm
for this method in Fortran.

Now I am beginning to study gravity inverse problems with
[/people/uieda], besides
learning Python and collaborating with
<a href="http://www.fatiando.org/">Fatiando a Terra</a> project.

I am also interested in Inverse Problems in general,
Seimic Processing and Interpretation, Petrophysics and
all the related things, as Rock Physics.
