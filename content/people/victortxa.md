## About

I work at LAGEX/UERJ since December 2014. I did a MSc in Geophysics at UFF, 
where I worked with seismic refraction tomography, implementing an algorithm 
for this method in Fortran. 

Now I am beginning to study gravity inverse problems with 
<a href="http://www.pinga-lab.org/people/uieda.html">Leonaro Uieda</a>, besides
learning Python and collaborating with 
<a href="http://www.fatiando.org/">Fatiando a Terra</a> project.

I am also interested in Inverse Problems in general,
Seimic Processing and Interpretation, Petrophysics and 
all the related things, as Rock Physics.
