## About

I'm a geophysicist working mainly on inverse problems in gravity and magnetics.

Starting February 2014,
I'm working as Professor of Geophysics at the
<a href="http://www.uerj.br">Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro</a>,
Brazil.
I teach the "Intro to Geophysics" courses to Geology students,
<a href="http://www.leouieda.com/teaching/">among others</a>.
A typical day at work usually involves a lot of
<a href="https://github.com/leouieda">open-source software development</a>,
for both research and teaching.
My language of choice is [Python](https://www.python.org/).
I'm one of the founders and main developer of
[Fatiando a Terra](http://www.fatiando.org).

In the spirit of open-science,
I share all of the research and
teaching material online under permissive licenses.
You'll find links to source code, images, lessons, etc, scattered around
my [personal website](http://www.leouieda.com)
(look for the <i class="fa fa-github-square fa-fw"></i> icon).

Follow me on [Twitter (@leouieda)](https://twitter.com/leouieda) for updates on
teaching and research, random things from the world of academia, etc.
